# 🈷️  WaniKani Kanji Cards

[🔗 wanikani-kanji-cards.darthorimar.me](https://wanikani-kanji-cards.darthorimar.me/)

I created this app to rapidly review the [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com) kanji at a level where I have unlocked (almost) all of them. It helps me retain kanji better in my memory and stop confusing them with each other :)

# 🏗️ Building

The app is hosted at [wanikani-kanji-cards.darthorimar.me](https://wanikani-kanji-cards.darthorimar.me), but it can also be built and run locally.

The app is written with Next.js and React.

- Use `npm run dev` to run a development version of the app.
- Use `npm run start` to run a production version of the site.
- Use `npm run build` to create a production build of the site.
